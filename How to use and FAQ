FAQ's

Why does my colourised image have a blue hue?

That is an error with the current alpha release and should be solved by the next update.

It didnâ€™t colourise accurately what can I do?

If you re-enter the image the algorithm will attempt again and hopefully be more accurate.

How does it work?

We trained a machine learning library called openCV on black and white versions of colour images
Tasking it to attempt to add colour in the black and white version to match the original
Repeat this step several thousand time and eventually it can do it without the guide.

When is the next update being released?

Hopefully sometime in early June.
Hopfully fixing our blue hue problem and giving the you more control over what the image looks like
